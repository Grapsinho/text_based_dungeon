We are building a text-based dungeon game. There are "rooms" that represents a new challenge for player.

Main mission is to find an exit and that where you win. Player has to overcome some of challenges, find items and lastly find an exit.

Gameplay:

    Exploration: The player moves room to room. 

    Encounters: In each room, the player might face an enemy, discover treasure, trigger a trap, or find the exit.

    Decision Making: At every step, the player must decide whether to fight, use an item, solve a riddle, or change direction

    Outcome: The player's actions affect their stats (health) and inventory, and determine whether they progress, gain rewards or suffer setbacks.


Room types and roles:

    Empty Rooms:

        This basically lets user to relax between more challenging encounters

        these rooms might have atmospheric descriptions and sometimes hidden clues or subtle hints about what lies ahead.

    Enemy Rooms:

        combat challenges

        enemies are encountered with description of their appearance, strength or any peculiar behavior

        Combat is resolved via a turn-based mechanism, where the player chooses actions like attacking, defending, or using an item.

        Defeating an enemy might reward the player with items or boost stats.

    Treasure Rooms:

        Reward exploration

        Treasure can also include items that can be used to unlock further parts of the dungeon.

        treasures might be hidden behind puzzles or locked chests, requiring the player to use a specific key or solve a riddle.


    Trap Rooms:

        Increase risk and tension

        traps may reduce the player's health

        Some traps might be avoidable if the player has a clue, a tool, or an item
    

    Exit Room:

        Serve as the goal and endpoint

        The exit is usually locked or hidden behind a challenge (like a riddle or a boss enemy).

        Reaching this room signifies victory, but the path there may require the cumulative use of items and knowledge gained along the way.


Items: Types, Purpose, and Usage:

    Items are central to the gameplay. They can be thought of as tools, rewards, or even strategic advantages that the player collects over time


    Keys:

        Unlock specific rooms or treasure chests.
        Serve as progress markers (you need a key to open the exit door, for example).

        When encountering a locked door or chest, the player must choose to “use” the key.
        Keys might be one-time use or rechargeable based on game design (if you have only one key, decide carefully when to use it).


    Potion:

        Restore health or provide temporary boosts (like increased strength or defense).
        Can also be used to neutralize certain traps.


        The player can decide to use a potion during or outside of combat.
        Potions require strategic management—using them too early might leave the player vulnerable in a later battle.

    Weapons and Defensive Tools:

        Although your game might assume a basic weapon is always available, special weapons can be rewards.
        They might improve combat outcomes against tougher enemies.


        In combat, choosing to use a better weapon could influence the damage dealt or provide unique effects (e.g., a flaming sword might do extra damage against certain enemies).
        Defensive items like shields might reduce damage from enemy attacks.


How Items Integrate with Game Mechanics:
    Inventory System:
        Tracking:
            The game maintains an inventory where every collected item is recorded.
            The player’s stats screen is updated with new items, showing what is available.
        Usage Choices:
            When faced with a decision (e.g., a locked door), the game might prompt the player with “You have a key. Would you like to use it?”
            In combat, the inventory could be accessible to decide if a potion is needed for a health boost.
        Strategic Depth:
            Since some items are consumable, the player must decide the best moment to use them. For example, using a health potion in a minor skirmish might not be as beneficial as saving it for a major boss fight.

    Interactions with Room Types:
        Enemy Encounters:
            Items like weapons or potions can change the tide of battle.
            Enemies might drop items upon defeat, rewarding the player and sometimes hinting at their use later.
        Treasure Rooms and Puzzles:
            Keys and artifacts are often hidden in treasure rooms, requiring exploration and sometimes solving puzzles.
            Puzzle solutions may depend on having seen clues in previous rooms, making the items part of a larger narrative puzzle.
        Traps:
            Items such as a potion may protect against traps.
            Some traps might require a specific item to disable, integrating the inventory system with the level design.


    Progression and Difficulty:
        Scaling Challenges:
            As the player collects items and improves stats, the challenges (enemy strength, trap severity) might also increase.
            This keeps the game balanced and engaging, ensuring that strategic item management is key to progression.
        Replayability:
            Randomized placement of items in the dungeon can offer a unique experience with each playthrough.
            Different items in different rooms force the player to adapt their strategy based on what they find.

Narrative and Atmosphere

    Storytelling Through Environment:

        Each room has a rich description that sets the mood—whether it's a dim corridor hinting at danger or a treasure room glowing with hope.
        The items and encounters are woven into the narrative. For example, discovering a weathered key in an enemy’s possession can hint at a larger backstory or mystery.

    Player Agency:

        The choices the player makes—whether to use an item, how to respond to a trap, or which direction to explore—drive the unfolding story.
        Dialogues, descriptive text, and environmental clues make the player feel like an active participant in a living, breathing dungeon.
